            <p>I loved my high school experience! I attended Spanish fork, timpview, and Timpanogos through my four years of high school! I joined FFA for two years and was the treasurer my second year. I was in the club FCCLA and competed in the star events for fashion design and places third in state and got a bronze medal at the national competition!

            <h2>Nick Schooley</h2>
            <p>Looking back, high school was fun, but if you had asked me a few years ago that would definitely not have been my answer. Moving to a new State and new school in Utah from South Carolina was not fun. I sat alone at lunch for the first two weeks. Then I met a bozo named "The Jack," and things got better from there. I met some great friends at school and in the ward, and then discovered my new passion: snowboarding. I like soccer, basketball, snowboarding, bumming around, boating, backpacking and some other things too. Plans after high school first include serving a mission to San Antonio,Texas. When I return, I'll be attending BYU here in Provo.</p>
            <p class="advice">Some mighty high school Wisdom I can bestow is, if your mom is making you take AP calc, take BC for the first semester, then switch to AB the second semester. You'll learn it much better. Also, avoid going number 2 in the school bathrooms, and don't bum around (too much).</p>

        <article id="james-wytiaz" class="senior-bio">
            <h2>James Wytiaz</h2>
            <p>Brief high school experience: James challenged himself in high school to take as many advanced courses as possible. He joined the marching band as a freshman and competed all four years, earning multiple awards, distinctions, 1st places, state, regionally, and nationally. James loved to represent the United States during Model United Nations and won Best Resolution this year. He has had the honor of being the trumpet solo for the past 4 Memorial Day and Veterans Day commemorations, and serving as a Trumpeteer at many funerals for veterans. In fact, he is missing this evening to perform his last jazz band concert. James has a love of academics, teaching himself Japanese to go with his fluent Spanish, earning 5s in AP Computer Science, AP Calculus, and more. Along the way he made great friends with his easy-going and bright personality.</p>
            <p>Interests and Hobbies: James is a born engineer. Since he arrived earthside he was taking things apart, drawing schematics for his inventions, analyzing why something did or didn't work, making everything more efficient, and building anything from scratch. He is a musician, pianist, and plays a mean trumpet. James loves all things design and architecture. But his true obsession is aviation. He can identify any plane in the sky, asks his parents to send him the itinerary and picture of every plane they fly, so he can tell them if it has the GE or Rolls Royce engine, when the plane rolled off the line, a short history of its maintenance logs, and where the plane has been and where it's going. Any flight we take must account for time to be at the airport for plane-spotting, to meet the pilot and first officers, and ask questions in the cockpit.</p>
            <p>Parent Comment: James has been a joy in our family. He is a peacemaker with a steady heart. He serves his family and community with dedication and a happy disposition. He sees needs and fills them. We are so excited to see his future endeavors!</p>
            <p>Future Plans: James has committed to the University of Utah with a scholarship, and will defer as he has opened his mission portal.</p>
            <p class="advice">James advice: Nobody is "smart". To be "smart", you have to be knowledgeable. Take the highest classes you can, even if you procrastinate all of the work. Always look for the highest opportunities. You're more capable than you know, you just have to know how to know first.</p>
