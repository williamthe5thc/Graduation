                    <p>She is on a club track team that runs year round and on the Timpview track team where she runs sprints and throws javelin. Timpview has won the state championship the last two years in a row and is going for a three peat this year.</p>
                    <p>In her words, her favorite part of school was that she got to know almost everyone at Timpview and had the chance to make friends from other schools, which made high school fun.</p>

                    <p><strong>Advice:</strong> "The longer you wait to do an assignment the older you are, and some people believe the older you are the wiser you are. Therefore the longer you wait to do an assignment the more wise you will be."</p>

                    <p>Looking back, high school was fun, but if you had asked Nick a few years ago that would definitely not have been his answer. Moving to a new State and new school in Utah from South Carolina was not fun. He sat alone at lunch for the first two weeks. Then he met a bozo named "The Jack," and things got better from there. He met some great friends at school and in the ward, and then discovered his new passion: snowboarding.</p>
                    <p>Plans after high school first include serving a mission to San Antonio, Texas. When he returns, he'll be attending BYU here in Provo.</p>
                    <p><strong>Advice:</strong> "If your mom is making you take AP calc, take BC for the first semester, then switch to AB the second semester. You'll learn it much better. Also, avoid going number 2 in the school bathrooms, and don't bum around (too much)."</p>
